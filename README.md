Each key in the 'globalyDeniedUrls' JSON object is a repository URL (like 'https://repo.maven.apache.org', 'https://repo.anaconda.com', etc.), and the value associated with each key is a list of repository types that are invalid for that URL. This section is used to prevent the creation of repositories with these URLs. Each key in the 'explicitlyDeniedUrlRoute' JSON object is a URL, and the value associated with each key is a list of repository types that are invalid for that URL. This section is used to prevent outbound requests from going to the exact match URL.

It is important that the URLs will be as minimal as possible and will not contain a trailing slash. Additionally, the repo type should match the RepoType enum.
